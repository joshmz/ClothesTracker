# ClothesTracker
-To Use, Open 'ClothesTracker.py'

- A simple clothes tracker written in [PYTHON] which gave me a firm basis in the modules: [PyQt5] [SQLite].
- Enter details in a GUI which then gets exported to an external local database.

-Code can be reused and repurposed as an Objet Oriented Programming paradigm is being utilized. This code can easily be modified to fit a registration form or something of that nature.
